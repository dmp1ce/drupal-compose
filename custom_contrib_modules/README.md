Contrib modules that have been modified go here. Usually this is going be a module we have included using a git submodule which has custom modifications we have applied manually.

An alternative to putting modules here is to use the 'patch' functionality of Drush make. The downside of the Drush make patch route is that a patch needs to be created and maintained. With a git submodule, the changes may be a little easier to keep track of.
